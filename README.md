Analysis of Different Tumor Reducing Drug Regimens

Pymaceuticals Analysis: Evaluation of Capomulin

This analysis seeks to evaluate the performance of Capomulin against a placebo and eight (8) other drugs in the shrinkage of tumors in mice.
The following is the top-level information needed to establish a context for the conclusions or recommendations for further study presented herein:
•	248 mice (125 Males and 123 Females) were part of the evaluation.
•	Tumor volume measurements (mm3) were taken every five days for each mouse up to 45 days.
•	Mice weight was also recorded throughout the process.

Key Observations:

Mice treated with Capomulin had a significantly smaller tumor volume at the end of their timeline than all other drug regimen except for Ramicane.  Additional analyses are needed to establish if a statistically significant difference exists between these two drugs.  These analyses should compare the following:

•	Descriptive statistics of the amount of shrinkage at time =0 and the last timepoint for each mouse for all drug regimens.
•	Sensitivity analysis across gender
•	Sensitivity analysis across weight

Comparison of the box and whisker plots for all drug regimens clearly depict a tighter and more predictive outcome for Capomulin than Ramicane, Infunimol, and Ceftamin.  Additional analyses must be completed to establish the level of statistically differentiation across the four regimens.
